# votecalc
Team voting tool useful for Agile story estimation among other things.

Author: Michael Wilkes

## Background
Having used multiple tools for remote planning, I found that there is one situation they do not handle well: A hybrid team that is both local (multiple people in the office) and remote. This scenario presents some unique challenges for gathering votes and calculating results.
This solution focuses on multiple votes arriving, not from logged in users, but from multiple locations (connections).
